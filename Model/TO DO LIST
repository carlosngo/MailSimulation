[1] DateTime.java - easiest so ito na unahin :D
[2] Mail.java - straightforward naman
[3] read about reading csv files na rin siguro
[4] given an arraylist of mails from different regions, add the mails that belong to the current 
region to the sorted list (not yet sorted)

That's it for now. If u hab questions let's discuss it in GC <3 Let's do our best! :D
